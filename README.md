Comprehensive F# bindings and tooling for the entire Cloudflare platform, bringing type-safe, functional-first development to edge computing and cloud infrastructure.

## Overview

CloudflareFS aims to provide complete F# bindings for Cloudflare's most recent SDKs, enabling developers to leverage the full power of Cloudflare services with F#'s type safety and functional programming paradigms. Built on [Fable](https://fable.io/) for JavaScript interop and utilizing [Glutinum](https://github.com/glutinum-org/cli) for automated binding generation, this toolkit bridges the gap between F# and Cloudflare's extensive service ecosystem.

### Key Goals

- **Complete Coverage**: Bindings for Workers, R2, D1, KV, Durable Objects, Queues, and 50+ Cloudflare services
- **Type Safety**: Full F# type safety across runtime and management APIs
- **Modern Architecture**: Support for emerging technologies (MoQ relay, Post-Quantum Cryptography)
- **Developer Experience**: Computation expressions, active patterns, and idiomatic F# APIs
- **Automated Generation**: 70% auto-generated from TypeScript/OpenAPI definitions
- **Enterprise Ready**: Dual MIT/Apache 2.0 licensing with patent protection options

## Installation

### Core Runtime (Workers/Edge)
```bash
dotnet add package CloudflareFS.Worker
dotnet add package CloudflareFS.KV
dotnet add package CloudflareFS.R2
```

### Management APIs
```bash
dotnet add package CloudflareFS.DNS
dotnet add package CloudflareFS.ZeroTrust
```

### Development Tools
```bash
dotnet tool install -g CloudflareFS.CLI
cf-tools init my-worker
```

## Architecture

CloudflareFS uses a two-layer architecture:

### 1. Runtime Layer (In-Worker APIs)
Bindings for code executing inside Workers, using Fable for JavaScript interop:
- **Core Types** âœ…: Request, Response, Headers, ExecutionContext
- **Storage** âœ…: KV, R2, D1 (each in separate focused projects)
- **AI** âœ…: Workers AI bindings
- **Planned**: Durable Objects, Queues, Analytics Engine, Vectorize

### 2. Management Layer (REST APIs)
F# clients for Cloudflare's control plane, generated using Hawaii from OpenAPI specs:
- **Planned**: Account management, DNS, Workers deployment
- **Planned**: Zero Trust (Access, Gateway, Tunnels)
- **Planned**: Resource creation (KV namespaces, R2 buckets, D1 databases)

## Current Implementation Status

## Advanced Features

### Computation Expressions

```fsharp
// Async KV operations with CE
let workflow = kv {
    let! user = env.USERS.get(userId)
    let! preferences = env.PREFS.get(userId)
    return combine user preferences
}
```

### Active Patterns

```fsharp
// Pattern matching for routing
match request with
| GET & Route "/api/users" -> handleGetUsers()
| POST & Route "/api/users" -> handleCreateUser()
| DELETE & Route "/api/users/:id" id -> handleDeleteUser(id)
| _ -> Response.notFound()
```

### Type Providers (Coming Soon)

```fsharp
// Type-safe environment bindings from wrangler.toml
type MyConfig = WranglerProvider<"./wrangler.toml">
let kv = MyConfig.Bindings.MY_KV_NAMESPACE // Typed!
```

## Emerging Technology Support

### Media over QUIC (MoQ)
Prepared for Cloudflare's MoQ relay infrastructure:
```fsharp
open CloudflareFS.MoQ

let relay = MoQClient("wss://moq-relay.cloudflare.com")
let! track = relay.subscribe("audio/main")
```

### Post-Quantum Cryptography
Support for X25519MLKEM768 and future PQC standards:
```fsharp
open CloudflareFS.PQC

let! config = PQC.configure {
    mode = PQCMode.Preferred
    algorithms = ["X25519MLKEM768"]
}
```

## Examples

### Basic Worker
```fsharp
open CloudflareFS.Worker

[<Export>]
let fetch (request: Request) (env: Env) (ctx: ExecutionContext) =
    match request.method with
    | "GET" -> Response.ok("Hello from F#!")
    | _ -> Response.methodNotAllowed()
```

### Durable Object with State
```fsharp
type ChatRoom() =
    inherit DurableObject()

    let mutable sessions = Set.empty<WebSocket>

    member this.onWebSocket(ws: WebSocket) = async {
        sessions <- sessions.Add(ws)
        ws.accept()

        ws.onMessage(fun msg ->
            // Broadcast to all sessions
            sessions |> Set.iter (fun s -> s.send(msg))
        )
    }
```

### Zero Trust Integration
```fsharp
open CloudflareFS.ZeroTrust

let! policy = Access.createPolicy {
    name = "GitHub Auth Required"
    decision = "allow"
    include = [ EmailDomain "@mycompany.com" ]
    require = [ GitHub { org = "mycompany" } ]
}
```

## Acknowledgments

CloudflareFS stands on the shoulders of giants. We extend our deepest gratitude to:

- **[Fable](https://fable.io/)** - The magnificent F# to JavaScript compiler that makes this entire project possible. Special thanks to Alfonso Garcï¿½a-Caro and all Fable contributors for creating and maintaining this essential bridge between F# and the JavaScript ecosystem.

- **[Glutinum](https://github.com/glutinum-org)** - The TypeScript to F# binding generator that automates 70% of our binding generation. Thanks to Maxime Mangel for creating this invaluable tool that turns TypeScript definitions into idiomatic F# code.

- **[F# Software Foundation](https://fsharp.org/)** and the entire F# community - For fostering a language and ecosystem that makes functional programming practical, enjoyable, and powerful. Special recognition to Don Syme and the F# language design team at Microsoft Research.

- **[Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com)** - For building an incredible edge computing platform and being steadfast advocates for open source. Your commitment to open standards, transparent development, and developer empowerment inspired this project.

- **Early F# Cloudflare Pioneers** - Particularly Zaid Ajaj for creating the original Fable.CloudflareWorkers bindings that proved F# on Cloudflare was possible, and the community members who've been advocating for better F# support on edge platforms.

This project is our contribution back to these amazing communities - a small "thank you" for all the tools, platforms, and inspiration you've provided. We hope CloudflareFS helps more developers experience the joy of functional programming on Cloudflare's platform.
